## Traditional Segmentation
Digital marketers today constantly strive to understand their users better. Instead of sending bulk campaigns to the entire user base and hoping for the best conversion, they use data to personalize campaigns. And carpet bombing has given way to targeted marketing.
Meanwhile, the attention span of a user is at an all-time low. From 15 seconds in 2000, it’s now generally accepted to be 8 seconds. People have no patience for notifications that are irrelevant.

## Traditional Segmentation Strategy
To send highly contextual and relevant communication to your users means having a good segmentation strategy. Without segmentation, you are hitting your entire user base with a one-size-fits-all campaign that will fail due to irrelevance. E.g., Event in Boston? Don’t send the campaign to users in San Francisco!
Marketers are well aware of the power of segmentation for improving relevance and optimizing costs. There are multiple segmentation strategies to reach out to users. They include grouping users by demographics, geographic, behavior, psychographics, etc. All of these segmentation strategies are based on the past information available on the users.
